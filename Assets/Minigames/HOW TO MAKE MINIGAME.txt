- Have a root object with MinigameController script
- Use time to determine the time limit (in seconds)
- Make your minigame, call MinigameController.Won() once you solve it
- Once done, make it a prefab
- Drag the prefab to MinigamesCoordinator in the Playroom scene
- Press "Start Game" button
- ...
- Profit

The coordinator instances and deletes the prefab in the scene, so is not necessary for it to be spawned before hand
